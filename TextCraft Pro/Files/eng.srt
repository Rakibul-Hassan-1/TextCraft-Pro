Hello everyone, I am Li Xinyuan, a Huawei lecturer.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the last class, we talked about the technical knowledge of VRP,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And the upgrade method of AC and AP devices.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In that lesson, let's talk about WLAN's knowledge.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In public places, WLAN is now a wide range of contact methods.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
As more and more people apply WLAN to access,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And our security requirements for WLAN will become higher and higher.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So in this section, I will tell you about it

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Some of WLAN's access to security, data security and configuration security related knowledge.

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
