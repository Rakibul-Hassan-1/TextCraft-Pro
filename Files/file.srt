00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello everyone, I am Li Xinyuan, a Huawei lecturer.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the last class, we talked about the technical knowledge of VRP,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And the upgrade method of AC and AP devices.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In that lesson, let's talk about WLAN's knowledge.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In public places, WLAN is now a wide range of contact methods.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
As more and more people apply WLAN to access,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And our security requirements for WLAN will become higher and higher.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So in this section, I will tell you about it

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Some of WLAN's access to security, data security and configuration security related knowledge.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's take a look together.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
After studying this section, you can know what security threats WLAN faces,

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then deal with these security threats, what security defense mechanisms do we have.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Of course, in the end, I will list some of our common access certification methods,

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is also more practical.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In our daily work, we can follow different access certification methods

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To distinguish which networks are safe enough and which networks are not safe enough.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In this way, our lessons are divided into five sections.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Safety threats and defense, access security, data security,

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
WLAN network use control and security configuration.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will also take a detailed look at this safety configuration in the experiment to see how to configure it.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
First of all, let's take a look at WLAN's security threat and defense.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Then we can see that in this topology, we have two APs,

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What about these two APs are completely open.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So what threat will it encounter?

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
WiFi has no authentication, in this case,

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Our attackers can connect our wireless network at will,

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
After connecting our wireless network, what about it?

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He can be able to have the ability to the entire network equipment,

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And users to attack.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So if you encounter unconfined wifi,

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Everyone must be careful.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then the second layer, the second security threat,

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is the encryption of this wireless data.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What does this mean?

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
In other words, we are in the process of surfing the Internet,

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Our equipment, which is our STA,

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Our terminal will communicate with our AP.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Then when communicating,

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If our data is not encrypted,

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then other devices can also receive the electromagnetic waves we sent, right?

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then if there is no encryption,

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You will know other devices,

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What does our information contain.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Then maybe our privacy is intercepted in unintentional.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So the third is the border threat.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's see that there is an illegal AP here,

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Then this illegal AP will release an same SSID,

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
For example, the SSIDs of this AP1 and AP2 are both Huawei.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So these two APs are legal.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But here is an illegal AP,

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The SSID it uses is also Huawei,

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The user may even be unknown to this illegal AP.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
in this case,

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The user's data will be sent directly to this illegal AP.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This hacker does not need to be caught in an empty mouth,

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Directly we will send the data to the user themselves.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is our common threats.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If the network is not authenticated, it will be attacked.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If the data is not encrypted,

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It will be easy to be captured,

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It is cracked by others to know what you transmitted.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The other is an illegal AP,

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Plum directly on the illegal AP,

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
All your transmission data will be intercepted.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So the corresponding threats we just mentioned,

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Then we now have some measures that correspond to their security defense.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The first one is the so -called security certification.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Everyone should have noticed this,

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If we go to public, we

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Will find a lot of wifi,

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But most of the wifi need a password,

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Then this guarantees that no casual devices can enter our network.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So for this security certification,

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We can also choose two -way certification.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Users can verify the server,

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The server can verify the user.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Then in this case,

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We can verify whether this AP is illegal.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Then what,

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A legal AP can also verify whether our user is illegal.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This is the so -called two -way certification.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This is our most common.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Then the second one,

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Data encryption and integrity.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
In other words, our data is in the process of transmission,

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This should be encrypted.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If not encrypted,

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Others can know our information in the empty mouth.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So,

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Once complete, we use this hash,

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And this MICS and CRC is guaranteed.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This way our server has received our data,

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You can know whether our data has been tampered with.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Such a function.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then the third is the so -called boundary security.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This boundary is safe,

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Do not design in our class,

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Just know it.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Border security,

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We are divided into this wireless intrusion detection system,

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There is also a wireless invasion defense system,

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Referred to as WIDS and WIPS.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So in our class,

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It focuses on security certification and data encryption and integrity.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The above is the content of the fifth section.
